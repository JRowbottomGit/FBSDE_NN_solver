# Project Title

FBSDE_NN_solver

## Description

* A Jax implementation of the neural network FBSDE solver for high-dimensional semi-linear PDEs.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The implementation is built on Jax and NumPy libraries

### Installing

* Jax installation instructions can be found here: https://github.com/google/jax

### Executing program

* The code is functional style so each script is self-contained and will run in isolation, for example:

```
python3 FBSDE_NN.py
